  <summary> 3-1 split </summary>
- When the player at first position takes the ball into contact, the link and centre are the players usually expected to support the attack. This leaves a complete 3-player attacking unit on one side of the field, and just one player, usually the wing, on the other side of the field. An attack on first creates a valuable 3-1 split field. The halfback can either pass to the 3-player attacking unit on one side of the ruck, or run the ball towards the wing on the other side. On the halfback's approach to the ruck, both he and the wing should be looking to see if there is an opportunity to join forces for an easy 2 v 1
			- link: calls "rot" or "weiß"
			- attack pod: can call a play; looks for weaknesse

  <summary> *peter* (put away) </summary>
			- An offload in the tackle to a support player hitting the ball at pace is a simple but extremely effective way to break a defence. And the 'put-away' is effectively just this- an offload in the tackle with support - but where the offload and support is coordinated and not spontaneous. Most offloads happen in a game on impulse, when the ball carrier frees his arms in a tackle and has close support running on to the ball. The 'put-away' is a play that ensures both of these things happen from one simple call.
			- The ball carrier must first identify which defender is marking him, and then let the inside player know his intention ('Hey, John, I'm going to put you away'). Remember the simple lesson of when the ball carrier runs right, space is created on the left and vice versa. In a 'put-away, the ball carrier identifies which defender is marking him, steps inside the defender, engaging him in a tackle, and then makes an immediate offload to a support runner hitting space outside. In a 'put-away, it is not necessary for the ball carrier to beat the defender outright, but just to get to his inside and stretch him enough to make any tackle a passive one, which allows the offload. The success of the offload will be determined by the quality of the run, and so the ball carrier must aim to be as dynamic as possible also maintain leg drive through contact and aim to offload.
