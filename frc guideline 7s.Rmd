## III. Basics structure

In this section, we’ll outline our team's basic structure and strategies, covering crucial aspects such as defense, attack, lineouts, kick-offs, and penalties. Each area will be discussed in detail to ensure everyone knows their role and how we approach different game scenarios. At the end of this section, you’ll find a table of contents with key terminology and a list of common calls used during matches.

<div class="tabset">

### Offense {.tabset}
#### Position on the field

<details>
  <summary><b> Setup for Offense </b></summary>
  
When attacking, players should stand in a "V" shape formation and try to maximize space in the field to stretch the defense and to help the team find or create gaps.
  ![](img/position_attack.png)
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b> 3-1 split </b></summary>
- When the player at first position takes the ball into contact, the link and centre are the players usually expected to support the attack. This leaves a complete 3-player attacking unit on one side of the field, and just one player, usually the wing, on the other side of the field. An attack on first creates a valuable 3-1 split field. The halfback can either pass to the 3-player attacking unit on one side of the ruck, or run the ball towards the wing on the other side. On the halfback's approach to the ruck, both he and the wing should be looking to see if there is an opportunity to join forces for an easy 2 v 1
- link: can call "rot" or "weiß"
- attack pod: can call a play; looks for weaknesse

  <summary> *peter* (put away) </summary>
			- An offload in the tackle to a support player hitting the ball at pace is a simple but extremely effective way to break a defence. And the 'put-away' is effectively just this- an offload in the tackle with support - but where the offload and support is coordinated and not spontaneous. Most offloads happen in a game on impulse, when the ball carrier frees his arms in a tackle and has close support running on to the ball. The 'put-away' is a play that ensures both of these things happen from one simple call.
			- The ball carrier must first identify which defender is marking him, and then let the inside player know his intention ('Hey, John, I'm going to put you away'). Remember the simple lesson of when the ball carrier runs right, space is created on the left and vice versa. In a 'put-away, the ball carrier identifies which defender is marking him, steps inside the defender, engaging him in a tackle, and then makes an immediate offload to a support runner hitting space outside. In a 'put-away, it is not necessary for the ball carrier to beat the defender outright, but just to get to his inside and stretch him enough to make any tackle a passive one, which allows the offload. The success of the offload will be determined by the quality of the run, and so the ball carrier must aim to be as dynamic as possible also maintain leg drive through contact and aim to offload.

### Defense
#### Position on the field
<details>
  <summary><b> Setup for Defense </b></summary>
  
When defending, our team should a straight line across the field. All seven players should stand side by side with no gaps between them. This way, you cover the entire width of the field and make it harder for the other team to break through. As the other team attacks, you move up together in your line, staying close to each other and communicating to make sure no one slips through. The goal is to keep the attackers in front of you, block their progress, and try to force a mistake so you can win the ball back.

![](img/position_defense.png)
</details>
		
<details>
  <summary><b> Basics of Defense </b></summary>

Most players should target the inside shoulder:
In defense, aiming for the inside shoulder of the ball carrier helps guide them toward the sideline, limiting their options and making it easier to tackle or force them out of play. This also prevents the attacker from cutting back inside, which could break the defensive line.
		
But the wing should target the outside shoulder:
By focusing on the outside shoulder, the winger can guide the attacker back towards the center of the field, where there are more defenders to help make the tackle. This approach also reduces the risk of the attacker breaking free along the wing, which is often the fastest route to the try line.

### Kick-offs
#### We are kickin'

</details>
		
<details>
  <summary><b> Setup for a Kick-off </b></summary>
  
<!--picture showing the set up-->

- 4 players on the side of a kick call 
  
</details>

<details>
  <summary><b> Calls </b></summary>

- *cover (rot/weiß)*: deep kick
- *robber (rot/weiß)*: short kick

So: If kicker calls *robber rot*, the expected result is a short kick to the right. If the kicker calls *cover rot*, the expected result is a deep kick to the right
